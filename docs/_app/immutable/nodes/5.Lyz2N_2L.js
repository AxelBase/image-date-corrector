Unlike many online tools, it processes everything directly in your browser, meaning your images never leave your device and no data is uploaded to any server. This makes it ideal for anyone concerned about privacy while organizing their photo library.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Many people encounter photos with wrong dates, especially when digitizing old prints, transferring images between devices, or using phones that sometimes fail to record the proper capture time. When the EXIF DateTimeOriginal tag is missing or incorrect, photo management apps like Google Photos, Apple Photos, or Windows Photos display the images in the wrong chronological order. This tool solves that problem by letting you set the correct date and time directly in the EXIF metadata.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Key Features</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">The tool supports both single images and batch processing. You can drag and drop multiple JPEG files at once, preview them, and adjust dates individually or apply the same date and time to all selected photos. Once corrected, you download either individual fixed images or a convenient ZIP file containing everything.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">It works even with images that have no EXIF data at all. The utility safely creates a minimal valid EXIF section and adds the DateTimeOriginal tag without re-compressing or degrading image quality. This ensures your photos remain pixel-perfect while gaining accurate timestamps.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Who Benefits Most</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Photographers restoring old family albums, archivists organizing large collections, and everyday users frustrated by misordered phone galleries all find this tool valuable. Because it runs entirely offline after loading, it works on any modern browser without requiring installation or account creation.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">Does it change the file system creation date?</summary> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">No. It only modifies the embedded EXIF capture date inside the image file, which is what photo apps use for sorting.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">Is my data private?</summary> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Yes.

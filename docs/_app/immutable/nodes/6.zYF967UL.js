The most important tag for chronological sorting is called DateTimeOriginal. When this tag is missing or incorrect, photos appear out of order in libraries and galleries.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">The EXIF Image Date and Time Changer performs all EXIF modifications entirely within your web browser using a JavaScript library called piexifjs. This approach ensures complete privacy because no image data ever leaves your device.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">The Process Step by Step</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">When you upload a JPEG, the tool first reads the file as a data URL. It then attempts to parse any existing EXIF data. If EXIF sections are present, it extracts the current DateTimeOriginal value if available. Even if no capture date exists, the tool can still proceed because modern browsers allow full manipulation of binary image data.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Once you set your desired date and time, the utility loads the EXIF object, updates the DateTimeOriginal tag, and also synchronizes the general DateTime field. If the image originally had no EXIF metadata at all, the tool creates a minimal valid EXIF structure with required fields like resolution values before inserting the new capture timestamp.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Finally, the modified EXIF block is inserted back into the original JPEG binary without re-encoding the image pixels themselves. This preserves full original quality and avoids any compression artifacts that would occur with traditional image re-saving.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">Why This Matters</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Traditional desktop software often requires installation and may still access your files in ways that raise privacy concerns. Cloud-based alternatives force you to upload photos to third-party servers. This in-browser method combines the convenience of a web app with the security of local processing.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1apmzc4"><summary class="svelte-1apmzc4">Does it affect image quality?</summary> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">No. The JPEG compression stream remains untouched; only the metadata section is modified.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1apmzc4"><summary class="svelte-1apmzc4">Why focus only on JPEG?</summary> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">JPEG is the only common format that reliably supports embedded EXIF metadata used by photo apps.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1apmzc4"><summary class="svelte-1apmzc4">Can it fix other EXIF fields?</summary> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Currently focused on capture date, but the underlying technology supports future expansion.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-1apmzc4">Understanding the technical process helps you trust that your photos remain private and unaltered in quality.</p></article></div>');function C(m){var e=I();b("1apmzc4",h=>{var s=z(),u=v(y(s),6);a(4),r(()=>n(u,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post2`)),f(()=>{g.title="How EXIF Date Correction Works In-Browser | Blog"}),i(h,s)});var t=o(e),d=o(t);a(4),l(t),a(2),l(e),r(()=>n(d,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),i(m,e)}export{C as component,x as universal};

This commonly happens with screenshots, images downloaded from the web, photos edited in certain apps, or files exported from older scanners. Without EXIF data, photo management software has no reliable way to determine when the picture was actually taken, often falling back to the file creation date instead.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">The EXIF Image Date and Time Changer is specifically designed to handle these cases. It can create a complete, standards-compliant EXIF section from scratch and embed an accurate capture date and time into images that previously had none.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">How It Works</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">When an image lacking metadata is uploaded, the tool detects the absence of EXIF sections. Rather than rejecting the file, it builds a minimal valid EXIF structure that includes all required fields such as resolution information and software identifiers. It then adds the DateTimeOriginal tag with the date and time you specify.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">This process ensures compatibility with all major photo applications. Once the new EXIF data is inserted, the image behaves like any normally captured photo in timelines and galleries.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">Common Use Cases</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">People digitizing printed photographs often scan images that end up without timestamps. By using this tool, they can assign the correct original dates so the digitized versions appear alongside modern photos in proper chronological order. Similarly, anyone restoring backups or recovering images from damaged storage benefits from being able to add missing dates manually.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">The ability to add metadata from nothing also helps when working with stock images or graphics that need realistic capture dates for archival purposes.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">Quality and Safety</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Importantly, adding EXIF data does not re-encode or compress the image. The original pixel data remains untouched, preserving full quality while simply appending the new metadata section.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-led0iy"><summary class="svelte-led0iy">Will photo apps recognize the new dates?</summary> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Yes. All major platforms including Google Photos, Apple Photos, and Windows Photos read the standard DateTimeOriginal tag added by this tool.</p></details> <details class="svelte-led0iy"><summary class="svelte-led0iy">Can I add other metadata like location?</summary> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Current version focuses on date and time, with location support planned for future updates.</p></details> <details class="svelte-led0iy"><summary class="svelte-led0iy">Is the added EXIF permanent?</summary> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Yes. The metadata becomes part of the JPEG file and survives copying, backups, and transfers.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-led0iy">Give your metadata-less images the proper timeline placement they deserve.</p></article></div>');function A(c){var e=E();w("led0iy",h=>{var s=b(),g=y(u(s),6);a(4),o(()=>r(g,"content",`${d??""}/blog/posts/post4`)),v(()=>{f.title="Adding EXIF Dates to Images with No Metadata | Blog"}),i(h,s)});var t=l(e),m=l(t);a(4),n(t),a(2),n(e),o(()=>r(m,"href",`${d??""}/blog`)),i(c,e)}export{A as component,P as universal};

The EXIF Image Date and Time Changer includes powerful batch processing capabilities that let you fix dozens or even hundreds of images in a single session, all within your browser.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">You can select multiple JPEG files through drag-and-drop or traditional file selection. Each image appears as a preview card, allowing you to verify contents before making changes. This visual confirmation helps prevent mistakes when working with large groups.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Two Ways to Set Dates</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">For maximum flexibility, the tool offers both individual and global date setting. You can adjust the capture date and time for each photo separately if they were taken at different moments. Alternatively, enable the global apply option to set the same date and time across every selected image, perfect for events or scanned batches from the same day.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">The interface clearly shows which images already have capture dates and which need new ones added. You can remove individual photos from the batch with a single click if needed, or clear everything to start over.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Convenient Download</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Once dates are set, a single button creates a ZIP file containing all corrected images. Each file receives a -corrected suffix to distinguish it from the original while preserving the base filename. This makes it easy to integrate the fixed versions back into your library.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Performance and Privacy</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Processing happens entirely on your device, so even large batches remain private. Modern browsers handle the workload efficiently, typically completing corrections in seconds per image.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1li990r"><summary class="svelte-1li990r">How many images can I process at once?</summary> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Browser memory limits apply, but hundreds of typical phone photos work without issues.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1li990r"><summary class="svelte-1li990r">Can I mix images with and without dates?</summary> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Yes. The tool handles both cases seamlessly in the same batch.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1li990r"><summary class="svelte-1li990r">Do originals get modified?</summary> <p class="svelte-1li990r">No. You receive new corrected copies while your originals remain unchanged.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-1li990r">Transform entire photo collections with accurate timelines in minutes instead of hours.</p></article></div>');function F(p){var e=_();b("1li990r",d=>{var s=P(),u=g(v(s),6);t(4),r(()=>n(u,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post5`)),f(()=>{y.title="Batch Processing Multiple Photos at Once | Blog"}),i(d,s)});var a=o(e),m=o(a);t(4),l(a),t(2),l(e),r(()=>n(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),i(p,e)}export{F as component,B as universal};
